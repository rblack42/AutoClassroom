An Instructor is the *owner* of a class organization. FOr this term, I am using
ACC-COSC2325-001-SU17, which brands my class to a particular section and term.
I might have several sections of this basic class each term, so the notation
helps keep them straight.

Owners (instructors) have full administrative rights to everythng managed
within the organization. The owner can create individual or team assignments
using the `GitHub CLassroom`_ control panel.
